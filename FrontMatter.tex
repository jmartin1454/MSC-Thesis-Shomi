\begin{abstract}
The existence of a non-zero neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) would violate parity and time-reversal symmetry.  Extensions to the Standard Model predict the nEDM to be $10^{-26}$ -- $10^{-28}$~e$\cdot$cm.  The current best upper limit set by Sussex/RAL/ILL nEDM experiment is $3.0 \times 10^{-26}$~e$\cdot$cm\cite{bestLim_1,bestLim_2}.  The nEDM experiment at TRIUMF is aiming at the $10^{-27}$~e$\cdot$cm sensitivity level.  We are developing the world's highest density source of UCN.  The experiment requires a very stable ($<$~pT) and homogeneous ($<$~nT/m) magnetic field ($B_0$) within the measurement cell.  

My involvement in the nEDM experiment is the development of active magnetic shielding to stabilize the external magnetic field by compensation coils. I have optimized a prototype active magnetic shield at The University of Winnipeg. I have also simulated the behaviour of the coils in the presence of the passive magnetic shields  using finite element analysis (FEA), and made comparisons with  experimental results  to test the successfulness of the control system. A major challenge of the active 
compensation system is its  slow current response.  This is now understood and several recommendations are made to improve the performance in future realizations of such a system.

%  This thesis discussed my journey to understand the system and recommendations for future researchers in active compensation field.



% .Moreover, the magnetic environment at TRIUMF is more challenging than in our lab in Winnipeg, because of the closeness of the experiment to the TRIUMF cyclotron (B $\sim 350 - 400$ $\mu$T 'which is almost one order of magnitude larger than usual background fields') and the changing environment with iron.  Studies of the implementation at TRIUMF will also be reported.
