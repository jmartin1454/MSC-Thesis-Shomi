\begin{abstract}
The existence of a non-zero neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) would violate parity and time-reversal symmetry.  Extensions to the Standard Model predict the nEDM to be $10^{-26}$ -- $10^{-28}$ e-cm.  The current best upper limit set by Sussex/RAL/ILL nEDM experiment is $3.0 \times 10^{-26}$ e-cm\cite{bestLim_1,bestLim_2}.  The nEDM experiment at TRIUMF is aiming at the $10^{-27}$ e-cm sensitivity level.  We are developing the world's highest density source of UCN.  The experiment requires a very stable ($<$~pT) and homogeneous ($<$~nT/m) magnetic field (B0) within the measurement cell.  My involvement in the nEDM experiment is the development of active magnetic shielding to stabilize the external magnetic field by compensation coils.  I have optimized a prototype active magnetic shield at The University of Winnipeg. I have also simulated the shield and coils using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). I have compared my experimental results with the simulation results to test the successfulness of the control system. I have faced problems in terms of slow coil current response for correcting the magnetic field change. I have successfully understand the slow current response problem. This thesis discussed my journey to understand the system and recommendations for future researchers in active compensation field.

% .Moreover, the magnetic environment at TRIUMF is more challenging than in our lab in Winnipeg, because of the closeness of the experiment to the TRIUMF cyclotron (B $\sim 350 - 400$ $\mu$T 'which is almost one order of magnitude larger than usual background fields') and the changing environment with iron.  Studies of the implementation at TRIUMF will also be reported.
