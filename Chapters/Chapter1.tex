\lhead{\emph{Motivation Behind the nEDM Experiment}}\label{ch:motivation} 
This chapter highlights the scientific interest in a new precise measurement of the neutron dipole moment (nEDM). Then, the measurement principle of the nEDM experiment is discussed with the importance of the magnetic environment for the successfulness of the experiment. Finally, this chapter ends with describing the TRIUMF Ultra Cold Advenced Neutron (TUCAN) nEDM experiment.

\section{Baryon Asymmetry}

\fig{Images/SM_Pic2}{width = 0.8\textwidth}{Three generations of matter aligned column-wise and classified into two groups : quarks and leptons. The figure is modified from the original figure of standard model of elementary particles of Ref.~\cite{SM_Pic}.\label{fig:SM_Pic}}{Three generations of matter.}

The universe is created from some fundamental particles which are governed by the four fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak interaction, strong interaction and gravitational force). The Standard Model (SM) has been created as a theory to classify the particles and relation among three forces excluding gravity. Six of each quarks and leptons are the fundamental particles which classify the matters based on the quantum numbers namely baryon carried by quarks and lepton number carried by leptons. They are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SM_Pic}. In the early universe, there were equal particle numbers of matter and antimatter. But the universe today contains almost only matter. By experimental observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) the baryon asymmetry can be deduced~\cite{expBar}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:baryons}
    \eta =\frac{n_b-\bar{n}_b}{n_\gamma}\simeq6.0 \times 10^{-10}
\end{equation}
where $n_b$, $\bar{n}_b$ and ${n_\gamma}$ are the number of baryons, anti-baryons and photons respectively. 

% So, this $6.0 \times 10^{-10}$ excess baryons over anti baryons per photon is called the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Scientists are continuously searching for the answer of this mystery. The breakthrough is possible by finding the non zero value of nEDM. 

The relation of the non zero nEDM with the baryon asymmetry has been discussed next.

\section{Sakharov Criteria and nEDM}
Baryogenesis is the process of creation of a baryon asymmetry from an initially symmetric state. In 1967, A.D. Sakharov described following three conditions on particle theories aiming to explain barayogenesis~\cite{Sakharov:1967dj}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Baryon (B) number violation.
    \item Charge (C) and Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry violation.
    \item Departure from thermal equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

Any theory which creates net baryon number obviously requires B-violating processes. Particle and antiparticle reaction must be different otherwise net baryon creation would be balanced by net anti-baryon creation. In thermal equation, forward reaction rates would balance backwards rates and no net baryon number could be produced. A departure from thermal equation is therefore required. The Big Bang and subsequent cooling of the universe offers a way to provide the departure from thermal equation~\cite{sakharov_3rd_cond}. Electroweak baryogenesis is one scenario which uses SM processes and the electroweak phase transition to explain baryogenesis. One drawback of the electroweak baryogensis is that there is no enough CP violation in the SM. This motivates new sources of CP violation near the weak scale.

% The first criterion can be explained by the second and third conditions. During the expansion of the universe immediately after the big bang, most of the particles were departed from the thermal equilibrium ( defined by the temperature of the universe between $10^{2}$ GeV and $10^{12}$ GeV ) at $\sim 10^{19}$ GeV temperature as suggested by Sakharov \cite{sakharov_3rd_cond} resulting in net non zero B number. The non zero B number also exists due to C and CP asymmetry. Because in the absence of those violations, excess baryon reactions can be nullified by the excess anti-baryon reactions \cite{sakharov_1st_cond}. Though the standard model of particle physics possesses CP violation, there is an insufficient amount of CP violation to explain the observed baryon asymmetry.  Theories of new physics beyond standard model, motivated in part by the baryon asymmetry, predict new sources of CP violation.

A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories is CPT symmetry, which implies that time-reversal (T) violation is equivalent to CP violation.  An electric dipole moment (EDM) is a measure of separation of oppositely charged particles within a system. To have a nonzero EDM, the system should not violate both parity (P) and time-reversal (T) inversion~\cite{edm_reason}. So, a search for a non-zero EDM represents a search for new physics that violates CP symmetry. The neutron may have an EDM with its magnitude depending on the nature and origin of the T violation~\cite{nEDM_reason}. A precise measurement of the nEDM could be a very important metric for explaining the baryon asymmetry on particle physics beyond the known interaction in the SM.

There are several experiments aiming at improving the uncertainty on the nEDM. The Fig. \ref{fig:lim} summarize all the results.

\section{Ultracold Neutrons}
Ultracold neutrons (UCN) are used to measure the nEDM. They have small kinetic energies ($<$ 300 neV). They can be confined in a material bottle as they are reflected at any angle of incidence off suitable material walls \cite{ucn_storage}. This provides long time frame (the mean lifetime of neutron is $\tau_n=881.5$ s \cite{mike}) for observation marking them ideal media for nEDM experiment. Their interaction with the neutron optical potential of the walls through the strong force enables to trap them. First UCN were produced in 2017 for TUCAN nEDM experiment using superfluid-helium at 0.9 K as the UCN production medium~\cite{TRIUMF_UCN,taraneh_theis}.

\section{Measurement Principle of nEDM}\label{sec:nEDM}

For the extraction of nEDM, Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields~\cite{ramsey} will be used. UCN will be polarized by passage through a strong magnetic field and guided to the nEDM cell. 

\fig{Images/ramsey}{width =\textwidth}{Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields, as applied to the measurement of the nEDM. $\bm{E_o}$ field parallel to $\bm{B_o}$ field in the left where in the right they are antiparallel. \label{fig:ramsey}}{Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields.}

%\FloatBarrier

The Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields for nEDM measurement has been shown in detail in Fig.~\ref{fig:ramsey}. It is seen that at the beginning and end of free precession short $\pi$/2 pulses are applied and polarized neutron detection after the pulse sequence is used to measure the free spin precession frequency $v$ (the Larmor frequency). In the first instance (left one in Fig.~\ref{fig:ramsey}), an electric field ($\bm{E_o}$) parallel to the magnetic field ($\bm{B_o}$) will be applied giving a spin-precession frequency as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:up_freq}
    h v_{\Uparrow \Uparrow}=2\mu_n\bm{B_o}+2 d_n\bm{E_o}
\end{equation}
where, $\mu_n$ and $d_n$ are the magnetic moment and electric dipole moment respectively, $h$ is the Planck's constant and arrows indicate parallel orientation of $\bm{E_o}$ and $\bm{B_o}$.
Now the same experiment is repeated with anti-parallel $\bm{E_o}$ (right one in Fig.~\ref{fig:ramsey})which gives the spin-precession frequency
\begin{equation}\label{eq:down_freq}
    h v_{\Uparrow \Downarrow}=2\mu_n\bm{B_o}-2 d_n\bm{E_o}
\end{equation}
where, the arrows indicate anti-parallel orientation of $\bm{E_o}$ and $\bm{B_o}$.
The measured change in the precession frequency (using Eq.~(\ref{eq:up_freq}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:down_freq})) can be used to deduce the nEDM via
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nEDM}
    d_n=\frac{h (v_{\Uparrow \Uparrow}-v_{\Uparrow \Downarrow})}{4\bm{E_o}}
\end{equation}

Since the NMR frequency is proportional to the magnetic field in the nEDM cell, the requirement is to have a very stable and homogeneous $\bm{B_o}$ field within the cell.


\section{Experimental Efforts So Far}\label{sec:lim}

Additional sources of CP violation beyond the standard model predict the nEDM to be in the range of $10^{-27}$ -- $10^{-28}$  e$\cdot$cm as compared to $10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-31}$ e$\cdot$cm predicted by the standard model \cite{theory_lim_1, theory_lim_2, theory_lim_3}. There are several experiments aiming at improving the uncertainty on the nEDM. 

\fig{Images/lim}{width = 0.9\textwidth}{Experimental nEDM upperlimit over the years \cite{1_lim,2_lim,3_lim,4_lim,5_lim,6_lim,7_lim,8_lim,9_lim,10_lim,11_lim,12_lim,13_lim,14_lim,15_lim,16_lim,17_lim} along with theoretical predictions \cite{theory_lim_1, theory_lim_2, theory_lim_3}. The vertical dashed line indicates the introduction of UCN. The light green region indicates the the nEDM limit in SUSY, M-theory and others while he light red region indicates for SM. \label{fig:lim}}{Experimental nEDM upperlimit over the years}

Figure~\ref{fig:lim} summarize all the results. Since the first measurement data published in 1957 \cite{1_lim}, the upper limit set on nEDM has been reduced by eight orders of magnitude over the last six decades. At 1980, ultra cold neutron (UCN) experiment overtook over neutron beam experiments on precision. The current best upper limit set by ILL/Sussex/RAL nEDM experiment is $3.0 \times 10^{-26}$ e$\cdot$cm (90 \% C.L) or $3.6 \times 10^{-26}$ e$\cdot$cm (96 \% C.L) \cite{bestLim_1,bestLim_2} and the experiment is performed at Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France). The new $^{199}\mathrm{Hg}$ EDM measurement constrains the nEDM better than direct nEDM measurements, $d_n$ $<$   $\mathrm{1.6\times10^{-26}}$ e$\cdot$cm, although subject to uncertainty from Schiff screening~\cite{schiff_screen}. The TUCAN nEDM experiment is aiming to constrain the uncertainty on the nEDM at the $10^{-27}$ e$\cdot$cm sensitivity level. 

The Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland) nEDM experiment uses an improved version of the former ILL/Sussex/RAL single-cell apparatus. Several innovations have been made at PSI, including a new SD2 spallation-driven UCN source. The experiment employs several Cs magnetometers outside the EDM cell, and a $^{199}\mathrm{Hg}$ comagnetometer. Active magnetic shielding and other environmental controls have been improved. A new detector that can simultaneously count both spin states of UCN has also been implemented. The final sensitivity expected is $\mathrm{10^{-26}}$ e$\cdot$cm~\cite{psi}. Some of the chief improvements made at PSI recently have been in the area of nearby alkali atom (Cs) magnetometry, Hg comagnetometry, and neutron magnetometry. A recent achievement at PSI is the understanding of the Cs magnetometer signals in terms of magnetic field gradients internal to the magnetic shielding. This has led to a detailed understanding of the false EDM of the Hg comagnetometer~\cite{psi_falseEDM}. Another recent achievement is in using the neutrons themselves to measure gradients~\cite{psi_n_gradient}. PSI also aims to improve their magnetometry with $^3\mathrm{He}$ magnetometers inside the electrodes of the double EDM measurement cells for their future n2EDM effort. They have performed R$\&$D using Cs magnetometers to sense the free-induction decay signal from $^3\mathrm{He}$, which resulted in a new high-precision magnetometer possessing excellent long-term stability\cite{psi_magnetometer}. The precision goal for n2EDM is $5 \times 10^{-28}$ e$\cdot$cm~\cite{psi_n2edm_nEDM-workshop,psi_n2edm_PPNS-workshop}.

The nEDM collaboration at Spallation Neutron Source (SNS, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) plans to measure $d_n\approx$ $2\times10^{-28}$ e$\cdot$cm, two orders of magnitude improvement from the current limit~\cite{sns_lim}. They plan to use a unique experimental technique. A Cold Neutron (CN) beam from the SNS will impinge upon a volume of superfluid $^4\mathrm{He}$ creating UCN. The nEDM measurement will also be conducted in the superfluid. A small amount of polarized $^3\mathrm{He}$ introduced into the superfluid $^4\mathrm{He}$ will act as both a comagnetometer and spin analyzer for the UCN. The $^3\mathrm{He}$ neutron capture rate is strongly spin dependent, and will beat at the difference of the Larmor precession frequencies of the neutrons and $^3\mathrm{He}$. A non-zero EDM would change the beat frequency with E-reversal. Scintillation light produced in the superfluid will be used to detect the capture products. The target precision is $10^{-28}$ e$\cdot$cm The false EDM of the $^3\mathrm{He}$ comagnetometer may be reduced by collisions in the surrounding $^4\mathrm{He}$~\cite{sns_false_edm}. The group aims to commission the experiment at SNS by 2020.

A new room-temperature nEDM experiment will be conducted using an upgraded
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL, Los Alamos, NM, USA) UCN source~\cite{lanl_nEDM-workshop}. The aim of the project is to increase the UCN density by a factor of five to ten, which could then be used to carry out a $\sim$ $10^{-27}$ e$\cdot$cm determination of the nEDM. The experiment aims for completion of a $10^{-27}$ level result, to be completed in the years prior to the SNS nEDM experiment, which shares a number of collaborators. Two other room temperature nEDM experiments are being pursued at the Forchungsreaktor Muncheon II (FRM2) reactor in Munich~\cite{frm2} and Gatchina reactor at ILL~\cite{PNPI}. Both experiments feature double measurement cells and Cs magnetometers internal to the innermost magnetic shield. The Munich effort features an impressive new effort in active and passive magnetic shielding~\cite{msr_design,shield_pnpi,shield_pnpi2}, and uses $^{199}\mathrm{Hg}$ comagnetometer. The ILL/Gatchina experiment has produced results at ILL~\cite{PNPI}. This could be improved in further runs at ILL in the EDM position, or in runs using the superfluid He UCN source at ILL, where a statistical sensitivity of $3.5 \times 10^{-27}$ e$\cdot$cm could be obtained~\cite{pnpi_nEDM-workshop}. The group will build a UCN source at the WWR-M reactor in Gatchina in order to increase the UCN flux.

\section{TUCAN nEDM Experiment}


\fig{Images/tucan}{width =\textwidth}{Conceptual design of the proposed TUCAN source and nEDM Experiment. The major portion of the biological shielding is not shown. Protons strike a tungsten spallation target. Neutrons are moderated in the $\mathrm{LD_2}$ cryostat and become UCN in a super fluid $^4\mathrm{He}$ bottle within, which is cooled by the superfluid $^4\mathrm{He}$ cryostat. UCN pass through guides and the superconducting magnet (SCM) to reach the nEDM experiment located within a magnetically shielded room (MSR). Simultaneous spin analyzers (SSA's) detect the UCN at the end of each nEDM experimental cycle. \label{fig:tucan}}{Conceptual design of the proposed TUCAN source and nEDM Experiment.}

The proposed TUCAN facility with designated place for nEDM experiment is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tucan}. A proton beam at 480 MeV and 40 $\mu$A from the cyclotron impinges upon the tungsten spallation target liberating fast neutrons. Above the target is a neutron moderator system containing liquid deuterium ($\mathrm{LD_2}$) which creates a large flux of cold neutrons (CN). The CN enter a bottle surrounded by the $\mathrm{LD_2}$ which contains superfluid $^4\mathrm{He}$ at below 1 K. In the superfluid, the CN excite phonon and roton transitions, losing virtually all their kinetic energy to become ultracold. 

Once a sufficient density of UCN has built up, a UCN valve opens. The UCN are transported out of the source by reflection on the surfaces of UCN guides. A superconducting magnet (SCM) transmits one neutron spin orientation in the magnetic field, giving near-unity UCN polarization and facilitating transmission through a vacuum-isolation foil at room temperature. The UCN are then transported to the nEDM experiment by additional guides. At the end of each nEDM experiment cycle, simultaneous spin analyzers (SSA's) detect the UCN.


In the upcoming chapter, the magnetic field system around the EDM measurement cell has been discussed in detail.

Finally, they are reduced to ultra cold speeds by phonon scattering in superfluid helium. After generating sufficient density of UCN, the proton beam is turned off opening a cryogenic UCN valve. The UCN then transported by reflection on the surfaces UCN guides and to accelerate polarized UCN through barrier foils to a vacuum volume at room temperature, a superconducting magnet (SCM) has been used. At last , UCN's are transported to the nEDM experiment via additional guides. At the end of each nEDM experiment cycle, simultaneous spin analyzers (SSA's) detect the UCN.
